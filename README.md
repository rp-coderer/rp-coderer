# Hi.

This is originally a joke account I made years ago as a joke.

Will be repurposed to store prompts, that I will share with the public on LLMs that will be used for roleplay. Oddly fitting name, I must be a time traveller.

All of the repos will be edited on vscode.dev and a private tab, so no actual code will be found, just plain old Markdown files. Or maybe images, idk.

## Contact

You know Patchouli Knowledge? Replace the first word with Physical and combine the two words. 

Shoot a DM on a site that sounds like "read it" (present tense).

I am not putting the actual username, as I don't want bots to DM me. That happened before.
